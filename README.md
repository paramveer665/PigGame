This is 2nd game which was developed as part of practicing Javascript and it was part of the exercise whos logic was totally developed in javascript.


clone this repo for practice.

use ``npm live-server``

and run it using ``live-server``

this code was refactored so minimum code should be used to compelte all the sections and functionalities. All the html and css code was present though I wrote all the logics for all the functionalities.
